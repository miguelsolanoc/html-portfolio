<h3>Rocky</h3>
<p>I like their music and I listen to it when training.</p>

<h3>Sing 2</h3>
<p>This is a musical movie I really enjoyed watching with my kids, and it reminds me of their early years.</p>

<h3>Coach Carter</h3>
<p>I like this movie because I watched it at a time in my life when I was struggling and I needed some hope and inspiration to move along.</p>
